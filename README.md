# Serial communication with DLP-TH1C

Provides only functions that communicate using ascii.  
In my environment, using byte, the dlp-th1c sensor loses some data for some reason (but I couldn't find).  
The "//string parsing" parts in various parts of the function were also written considering data loss.
